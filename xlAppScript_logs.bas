'
'
' Version 1.2.0
'
' [ Date: 1/31/2023 ]
'
' (1): Added "clear" statement for removing a named range value by it's index
'
' (2): Added "while" instruction for looping until a set condition is not met
'
' (3): Added "group" structure & "call" instruction for organizing code into recallable blocks
' ***Groups are similar to subprocedures as a "group" will not return a value
'
' Example:
'
' group(groupName){@xlasCode;}endgroup;   <--- Create group
'
' call(groupName);    <--- Parse group
'
' (4): Added "get" statement for retrieving a value from a named range by it's index
'
'
'
' [ Date: 1/30/2023 ]
'
' (1): Complete refactor of lexer & parser architecture
'
' (2): "for-next" support
'
' (3): Use of collections for parsing through tokens as opposed to stringing tokens through functions
'
' (4): Added special character support for braces "{ }" & brackets "[ ]"
'
'  Left Brace = [lbr]      Left Bracket = [lbrk]
'  Right Brace = [rbr]     Right Bracket = [rbrk]
'
'
'[ Date: 1/29/2023 ]
'
' (1): lexer/parser readability changes
'
' (2): Changed "lexKey" function call to "xlas"
'
' (3): Added "[dblquote]" & "[sinquote]" special characters for returning double or single quotations
'
'
'[ Date: 12/30/2022 ]
'
' (1): Changed instruction pointer separator ",#!" --> [,]"
'
'
'
'[ Date: 12/24/2022 ]
'
' (1): "let" instruction has been changed to "set" instruction ("let" properties will remain the same for "set").
'
' ***When setting a variable's value to another variable's value you can use the "set" article.
' ***Another method is to use the "=" operator between the variables.
'
' Example(s):
'
' set @var1=@var2; <--- @var1's value will equal @var2's assigned value
'
' @var1=@var2; <--- @var1's value will equal @var2's assigned value
'
'
' (2): Fixed bug in "kinSet" function where setting a variable to another variable using an article like "sum()" would
' cause the parsed variable to equal itself.
'
' (3): Fixed bug in "kinSet" function that disallowed multiple variables from parsing their values when used on the same line
'
' ***Performing an operation on a variable assigned to itself will cause the assigned variable value to take precedence.
'
' Example(s):
'
' @var5=sum(@var1 + @var2 + @var3 + @var4 + @var5); <--- This will equal @var5's assigned value
' @var6=sum(@var1 + @var2 + @var3 + @var4 + @var5); <--- This will equal (@var1 + @var2 + @var3 + @var4 + @var5)
'
'
' (4): Changed "[feed]" special chracter string to "[lf]" for "Line Feed"
'
'
'
' Version 1.1.6

' [ Date: 4/23/2022 ]
'
' (1): Removed "enableWbUpdates" & "disableWbUpdates" functions from running automatically, and moved them to the "xbas" lib
' as a library dependent switch.
'
'
' (1): Adjusted "kinSet" & "kinExpand" functions to accept alternative cases w/ variables such as parsing a variable call identifier
' (@) or (=) through a file or when needing to set a variable value from another variables value.
'
' Variable Preservation Sequence = %@var
'
' Example: %@var=read(-all @filePath); <--- if the text in this file contains an "=" this will still return all text to the assigned variable
'
'
' Version 1.0.8
'
'
' [ Date: 4/20/2022 ]
'
' (1): Added function for removing the "%" alternative variable escape character.
'
' When "%" is used in front of a call to a variable like "%@var" if the variable contains "@" within a string
' it will parse through the "@" identifier as if it's a normal string instead of interpreting the string containing @
' as a variable.

'
' (2): Fixed "if-else" instruction not parsing parentheses in certain instances
'
'
' [ Date: 3/31/2022 ]
'
' (1): Made adjustments to escape character function & added return function for retrieving values before searching through
' a library.

'
'
'
' [ Date: 3/8/2022 ]
'
' (1): Added "libcall" instruction to allow directing an article string/block to a desired library. This will place the
' desired library at the top of the library stack, which will help cut down on article querying time & avoid collisions
' where articles from different libraries share similar names.
' (in instances where many libraries are used, this will allow those lines/blocks of code to parse quicker).
'
'
' [ Date: 3/7/2022 ]
'
' (1): Added an escape key function & sequence for retaining special character(s) during parsing
'
' Example: --->  [^$] (for escaping the '$' symbol)
'
'
'
'
' Version 1.0.4
'
'
'
' [ Date 3/2/2022 ]
'
' (1): Added "Alternative Expansion" functionality & characters "{", "}", & "~" which allow articles to ignore initial parsing.
'
' Replace enclosers/enders (() & ()) w/ ({) & (}), & (;) w/ (~)
'
' w/ Alernative Expansion = rng{A1}.value{100}.bgcolor{gainsboro}.fcolor{cornflowerblue}~$
' w/o Alternative Expansion = rng(A1).value(100).bgcolor(gainsboro).fcolor(cornflowerblue);$
'
' (2): Added check for "<blk>" article.
'
' The "<blk>" article's purpose is for manually setting the runtime block (worksheet)
'
'
' (3): Seperated instructional components from lexer (goto, if, do, etc.) into respective functions.
'
'
' (4): Fixed issue's w/ placing an if-statement within a do-loop & vice versa

' ***Changed it in a way to allow editing the name of the worksheet w/o it affecting the current runtime block
'
' (2): Created 3 functions to deal w/ cleaning up an article during parsing (modArtP, modArtQ, modArtS)
' ***Removes parentheses, quotations, & spaces
'
' (3): Seperated loops & conditionals from "lexKey" function & instead put them into their own respective functions
'
' (4): Adjusted do-loops to support nesting if statements
'
'
' [ Date 2/27/2022 ]
'
' (1): Revised "if" statement lexing to check for boolean & seperate initially before setting variable values due to retention
' of the first article following the conditional check during variable parsing.

'
'
'
' [ Date 2/4/2022 ]
'
' (1): Edited "kinSet" function to double check if variable was found and recheck if not before expanding.

'
' Version 1.0.1
'
'
' [ Date: 1/6/2022 ]
'
' (1): Adjusted lexKey to only remove the leading & ending "()" from a declared "kin" variable. Initially would remove all parentheses
' from the article, but this would cause problems in a scenerio where we still needed the parentheses to identify a command.
'
'
'
'
'
' [ Date: 1/5/2022 ]
'
' (1): Created kinExpand function to help w/ expanding (setting the value of a variable) before, & @ runtime.
' ***Working to solve an issue where if a variable is declared w/ a value & needed again for an article such as repl() or input(),
' the variable will still retain the value it was declared as instead of expanding (will work fine when set to nothing, or

'
'
'
' Version: 1.0.1
'
'
' [ Date: 1/6/2022 ]
'
' (1) Added "ins()" article to find a char/string within another string/variable
'
' ***Will return "TRUE" or "FALSE"  to the assigned variable based on if the char/string searched for was found or not
'
' Syntax: @var = ins(@startPosition, @strToSearch, @strToFind, @compType)
'
' (2) Added "app.run(") or simply the "run()" article to allow for running a module within an opened workbook
'
' ***Currently only supports a single listed (,) argument
'
' Syntax: app.run(moduleName.subName, (arg)); also run(moduleName.subName, arg);
'
' (3) Added pc power articles as well as a copy-paste articles
'
' ***pc.shutdown & pc.reboot articles accept the "-e" switch for auto logging in & bringing up the
' previous session on start-up, & "-t" for setting a timer before shutdown.
'
' pc.copy&() = copy & paste file or folder
' pc.copy&!() = copy, paste, & delete copied file or folder
' pc.shutdown() = shutdown pc
' pc.off() = logoff
' pc.rest() = set pc to rest mode
' pc.reboot() = restart pc
' pc.clr = clear shutdown queue
'
'
'
' [ Date: 1/5/2022 ]
'
' [ Edited: 5/4/2022 ]
'
' (1) Added "repl()" article to replace a value within a string
'
' Syntax: @var = repl(@strToReplace, @strToFind, @strToReplace, @compType)
'
' ***If using 3 arguments like: @var = repl(@strToReplace, @strToFind, @strToReplace) the default comparison method
' will be binary.
'
'
' (2) Added "dfil()" & "ddir()" articles to delete files/folders
'
' ***ddir() will only delete a directory if it's completely empty, so in that instance you could
' use the del.dir() article instead to remove everything.
'
'
'
' [ Date: 1/4/2022 ]
'
' (1): Changed all replace & string check commands for articles to ignore case
'
' ***User can type sh( or SH(, q(, or Q(, etc. & that will be accepted as the same article
'
'
' [ Date: 1/3/2022 ]
'
' (1): Added "q()" article which allows the user to query search either a file or folder (depending on the (.)extension.
' W/ this command you can check for the existance, open, delete, or taskkill a file/folder.
'
' ***q() command is able to search through a total of 3 sets of directories starting from a local drive & base folder.
'
' User only needs to include the drive & base folder.
'
' Examples of drive & base folder:
' C:\Users\ <----
' C:\Windows\ <----
'
' Syntax: q(C:\Users\@fileToQuery).exists (this will prompt whether a file exists or not & it's location)
'
'
' [ Date: 1/2/2022 ]
'
' (1): Added change log, license information & library requirements. Edited library description.
'
' (2): Adjusted "key()" article so it could be split into 7 locations & variables based on a numbered reference (0-6)
' This helped stop collisions w/ VBA, & VBS when the VBA parser ran quicker than the variable was released from the previous run
'
' (You'd likely only come across this issue when trying to run consecutive key() articles w/o using a wait() offset in-between).
'
' ***Numbered references will also be attributed to a corresponding VBA shell mode (0-6) when ran
'
' (3): Shell mode can now be set for sh() article (shell modes (0-6) will correspond w/ the same VBA shell modes (0-6)).
'
' (4): When opening, activating, & "saving as" a workbook, the application environment will be linked to that workbook.
' (This helped w/ navigating back to the original application environment when performing those actions due to the newly
' opened, activated, or saved workbook now being the one activated)
'
' ***Linking is simply just relaying to the same cell (memory location), name ("xlasEnvironment"), & value (current runtime environment) to the currently
' activated workbook.
